                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm a producer from BC, Canada who's had a passion for making music as long as I can remember.</p>
                    <p>I first got into production when my parents got me FL Studio at the age of 12, though I'd been messing around in GarageBand for at least a couple years by that point. I wanted to make songs just like my favourite dubstep musician at the time: Xtrullor (if you don't know who that is, <a href="xtrullor.newgrounds.com">go check him out on Newgrounds</a>).</p>
                    <p>Though I started making dubstep, my style evolved over time, and I started making hardcore techno, hard dance, and most recently idol pop, as well as composing orchestral and concert band pieces from time to time. </p>
                    <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                    <h2>Where To Find My Songs</h2>
                    <p>Most of the songs I post end up going on my Newgrounds page, and I'm on most major streaming services as well. Newgrounds is probably the best place to listen to my newer music.</p>
                    <p>If you want to listen to a track I've collaborated on that I'm not listed as an artist on, I'll probably put an archive of my collaborations somewhere on this site in the future.</p>

                                I made this track a fairly long time ago based off of the album art, itself a drawing by a YouTube animator named Atlas Crossman of a character Dillon from their series <i>Boku no Akuma</i>. While a big deviation from my (mostly unreleased) style at the time, it was a very fun track to make.</p>

                                Cover art by spookynya. I really like the original of this song, so I decided to remix it one day and came up with this. I quite enjoy how it turned out, especially the kick in the video, since I'd never designed one like that before.</p>

                                I would be remiss if I didn't pay homage to <i>Nyan~ Neko Sugar Girls</i>, a YouTube animated series about a couple of neko girls, one of whom was drawn on the cover by spookynya. I watched the series first in band camp when I was 14 and it's changed the trajectory of my life more than I ever thought it would. Something something brostep banger.</p>

This song was one of five demos that we recorded for an animation challenge I provided songs for. Phantasmagoria, or Phasma for short, have since welcomed me aboard as a member of their team, and they can be found in the links below.</p>

                                <p>In high school, me and my friend got together as Hammy Double G and Sl1pz and started work on a rap project. Most of our songs weren't very good, but as we grew we learned how to make music that was and it sounds like this. With me as the producer, the Lake Boys make a variety of styles from meme rap to hyperpop and everything in between. This song in particular has album art by spookynya. Here are our social media.</p>
